### Climate-Model

This is my own personal attempt to build a climate model to predit the impact of increasing greenhouse gasses on global average temperature. I would like to expand this project to predict other events such as natural disasters by location, poverty rate and mortality rate. 

The primary of purpose of this porject is to explore and practice accepted data science practices. 

Folder purposes:

Project
 
- src: source code for data exploration and model training

	-  preparation: Retrieve data from data source

	-  processing: ?

	- modeling: Assemble/Combine pieces of model

-  test: test cases for asserting Python code
 
-  model: Store binary file for local use/store intermediate results. Also metadata such as date and size of training data

-  data: store subset data for experiments. Both raw and processed data.

	-  raw: raw data

	- processed: processed data

-  notebook: store all the following notebooks

	- eda: Exploratory Data Analysis. For example: data distribution

	- poc: Proof-of-Concept

	- modeling: model building and training

	- evaluation: performance/evalution of model
